Lazyness

Lazyness is a collection of functions to make the closures easy to create and
pipe. It uses haskell keywords as often as it can ( take, takeWhile, cycle,
filter, fold, mapM, mapM_, ...) 

In real world, Lazyness = on-demand + memoization

In haskell, it's something like:

    type Lazy a = IORef (Either (() -> a) a)

Lazyness.pm is more than OCaml Steams as it only implements On demand (i would
like to figure out how to use memoization without adding a structure level to
the code).

TODO

some new functions where pushed 'as it' from scripts i wrote using Lazyness.
They have to be tested and documented.
